# Data Scientist | CS Grad Student @UMass Amherst

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Infoedge India Limited (_Jul 2021 - Jul 2023_)**
- Helped recruiters identify potential candidates from a large pool of applicants using Natural Language Processing
- Designed and implemented a sophisticated two-stack architecture (Feature Engineering -> Modelling) and successfully trained on an extensive dataset of over 50 million users' job switch data, gaining valuable insights into job transition behaviors
- Deployed stateless API in production using Python, and Flask. Serving 25-30 lakhs hits per day (inference time: ~80ms per sample)

**Skills:** Python, Applied Machine Learning · Deep Neural Networks (DNN) · Flask · PyTorch · Large-scale Data Analysis

**Data Science Intern @ Gyan Data Private Limited (May 2019 - Jul 2019_)**
-Trained a fuel consumption prediction model based on polynomial regression using weather forecast data and ship’s parameters
- Built a ship’s ETA prediction model based on a combination of first principles and forecasting data as features
- The fuel consumption prediction model had an error of ±11%, while the ETA prediction model had an error of ±8%

**Skills**: Regression-based Modelling, Feature Engineering

## Academic Projects
### Conversational AI-Bot for Financial Markets @ Dual-Degree Project - IIT Madras
- Primary objective was to extract essential information from a given financial query using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Prepared a training dataset using SOTA paraphrase generation models, back translation, and synonym replacement
- Trained an intent classifcation and named entity recognition (NER) models, and it achieved an test accuracy of 72%

### Document Search Engine @ Course Project IIT Madras
- Built an efficient document search engine using statistical NLP methods
- Implemented latent semantic analysis (LSA) on TF‑IDF matrix for compact representation and k‑means clustering for efficient retrieval
- Achieved mean average precision(MAP)@10 = 0.69, clustering optimized retrieval time by 3x on the caveat that reduced MAP@10 by 9%

## Data Science Competitions

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
